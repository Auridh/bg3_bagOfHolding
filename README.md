## How to get the bag?
Buy from one of the following traders (_you may need to take a long rest to allow the traders inventory to refresh_)
* Arron at the druid grove (_has one bag_)
* Volo (_has one and later two bags_) (_not while he is in the goblin camp_)
* Danthelon in Act 3 (_has four bags_)

If you have the _Tutorial Chest version_ you can also use the [Tutorial Chest Summoning](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/457) mod.
